Today I started using Obsidian. So this tool is much easier to understand than LogSeq. I started with building out my DnD DM Notes and really like the graph view. Next I started some Ramen Cart notes as a concept of something I want to do one day. I hope this becomes a regular practice. I also mentored a co-worker today and felt pretty good about taking control of a meeting and speaking to the client as well.
